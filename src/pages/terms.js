The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (“Terms of Service”) govern your access to and use of www.getsoulapp.com, including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through www.getsoulapp.com, the mobile application, and related services (the “Services”), whether as a guest or a registered user.

## 2. Services

Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Services.

If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy,  
you must not access or use the Services.

By using the Services or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy incorporated herein by reference.

The Services are offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Services.

We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. However, any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set out in Governing Law and Jurisdiction will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice or before the date the change is posted on the Services.

Your continued use of the Services following the posting of revised Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

## 3. Accessing the Services and Account Security

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Services, and any service or material we provide on the Services, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Services, or all of the Services, to users, including registered users.

You are responsible for both:
1. Making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Services.

To access the Services or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information.

You agree that all information you provide to register with the Services or otherwise, including, but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features on the Services, is governed by our Privacy Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy.

If you choose, or are provided with, a username, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to the Services or portions of it using your username, password, or other security information. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your username or password or any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.

We have the right to disable any username, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Service.
